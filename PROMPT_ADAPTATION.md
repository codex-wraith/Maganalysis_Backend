# Prompt Adaptation Documentation

This document explains the changes made to adapt the prompt logic from the non-MCP version to the current MCP-based version of the CipherAgent.

## Overview of Changes

The adaptation focused on two main areas:

1. **Respond Method**: Modified to dynamically inject data for specific commands
2. **Analyze Asset Method**: Redesigned to use direct data gathering and better prompt formatting

## Specific Changes

### 1. Respond Method

The `respond` method in `aiagent.py` was updated to handle special commands directly instead of relying on MCP tools. This includes:

- **Search Commands**: Enhanced handling for "news:", "deepsearch:", and "search:" commands using Tavily
- **Intraday Command**: Direct data fetching and formatting for intraday financial data
- **Top Movers Command**: Direct data fetching and formatting for market movers
- **Current Price Command**: Direct exchange rate fetching and formatting

The generic MCP tool call for market analysis was removed to favor using the dedicated `analyze_asset` method when requested.

### 2. Analyze Asset Method

The `analyze_asset` method was completely restructured to:

- Use direct data gathering through helper methods (`_analyze_timeframe`, `_analyze_multi_timeframe_levels`)
- Construct a comprehensive `technical_indicators_text` string with formatted indicator data
- Simplify the LLM system prompt to base instructions plus plain text directive
- Create a detailed user message for the LLM with technical data, sentiment, and formatting guidance
- Implement final output assembly using `PromptManager.get_market_analysis_prompt()`

## Helper Methods

All necessary helper methods were verified to be present in the codebase:

- `_format_base_prompt`
- `_is_admin_user`
- `_get_current_datetime_info`
- `_format_conversation_history`
- `_extract_ticker`
- `_extract_interval`
- `_determine_asset_type`
- `enhance_with_sentiment`
- `is_recent_date`
- `get_volume_comment`
- `format_indicator_value`
- `_format_price`
- `_format_volume`
- `_sanitize_numeric_field`
- `_analyze_timeframe`
- `_analyze_multi_timeframe_levels`

## Testing

A simple test script (`test_prompt_adaptation.py`) was created to verify the main changes. Due to the dependency on market data API calls, the tests are designed to be more of a verification checklist rather than automated tests.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:

1. Add more sophisticated formatting for intraday data
2. Improve caching for expensive API calls to reduce latency
3. Enhance error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. Implement more comprehensive testing with mock market data

## Usage

No changes to usage are required. The adapted code maintains the same interfaces and functionality as before, just with improved prompt handling and more direct data gathering.
