Highlights all key technical indicators and their significance",
    "timeframe_expectations": "Generate target prices and stop losses that reflect realistic market volatility and offer a worthwhile risk/reward ratio. Avoid overly tight profit targets and stops. For example, for 5min/15min timeframes, set targets around 3-8% for stocks and 5-15% for crypto; for hourly charts, use 4-10% for stocks and 8-20% for crypto; for daily charts, aim for 10-25% for stocks and 15-50% for crypto; and for weekly charts, target 20-40% for stocks and 40-100%+ for crypto. Ensure that stop losses are wide enough to accommodate normal price swings while still protecting capital.",
